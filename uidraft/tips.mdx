# Tips & tricks

## Build incrementally
- Focus on one section at a time; validate after each step.

## Manage credits wisely
- Iterate freely; credits are only consumed when confirming a result.

## Keep patterns consistent
- Favor reusable patterns and shared tokens (colors, typography, spacing).

## Optimize assets
- Use optimized images and SVGs; keep layouts responsive.
