UIdraft Make helps you design pages in Figma with natural language.
Whether you want to create a brand-new layout, extend an existing page, or edit specific sections — you can do it all directly inside Figma with just a few clicks.

## Create a Brand-New Design

**Goal:** Generate a full page layout that matches your style and needs.

**How to Use:**
1. Open the plugin and select "Generate → A Brand-New Design."
   You'll enter the mode for creating a new page from scratch.

2. Choose a style reference (3 options):
   - **Choose Style Reference:** Click any Frame or Group in Figma to use its style as a reference.
   - **Upload Image:** Upload an image — UIdraft Make will use its visual style for generation.
   - **Skip:** Skip this step to use the default style.

3. Select the target platform:
   - Generate on Web Page
   - Generate on Mobile Page

4. Describe the page or feature
   Use plain English to describe what you want to create. For example:
   "A SaaS product landing page with a hero section, sign-up form, and customer logos."

5. Generate and import
   - Click Generate to create your design.
   - If you're not happy with the result, edit your description and try again.
   - Once you're satisfied, click Import to Figma to add the generated layout directly to your Figma file.

## Extend or Edit an Existing Page

**Goal:** Add new content or modify existing sections while keeping the original page's style and structure.

Open the plugin and choose "Extend or Edit → An Existing Page."

### Extend — Add New Content

Use this mode when you want to expand a page with new sections or modules.

**Steps:**
1. **Click Target Page**
   In Figma, select a Frame or Group to set it as your target page.

2. **Add a Frame (the generation area)**
   - Create a new Frame within your page.
   - This Frame defines where the generated content will appear and how big it will be.

3. **Select the target platform:**
   - Add on Web Page
   - Add on Mobile Page

4. **Describe what you want to add**
   Example:
   "Add a testimonial section with user quotes and photos at the bottom of the page."

5. **Generate and import**
   - Click Generate to see the new design.
   - You can refine your input and re-generate if needed.
   - When you're happy, click Import to Figma — the new content will appear exactly where your Frame is located.

### Edit — Modify Existing Elements

Use this mode when you want to replace or improve a section of your page while maintaining the overall design style.

**Steps:**
1. **Set the target page**
   Select a Frame or Group in Figma to define which page you're editing.

2. **Click a section to edit**
   Use "Click on a node to edit in #Frame" to select the specific element or section you want to modify.

3. **Select the target platform:**
   - Edit on Web Page
   - Edit on Mobile Page

4. **Describe the changes you want**
   Example:
   "Change the hero section to feature three product cards with pricing and CTA buttons."

5. **Generate and import**
   - Click Generate to preview your updated section.
   - If the result isn't perfect, adjust your description and try again.
   - Once it looks right, click Import to Figma — your edited section will automatically replace the original element.

## Tips for Better Results

- **Be specific in your prompts**
  The more detail you include (structure, style, and content), the better your generated design will match your expectations.
  Example: "A clean, minimalist SaaS login page with left-side logo, right-side form, and a light blue color palette."

- **Use a style reference whenever possible**
  Choosing a Frame as your style reference helps maintain visual consistency across your project.

- **Iterate freely**
  Not satisfied? Just rewrite your prompt and regenerate — the AI will adapt instantly.
