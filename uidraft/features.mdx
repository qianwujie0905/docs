## AI‑assisted UI generation
- Describe what you want in plain language; UIdraft generates clean, modern layouts using style‑aware templates.
- Fully editable results: adjust layout, colors, text, and images just like a traditional design draft.

## Editable Design
- Visual edits for copy, color, spacing, grids, and responsiveness.
- Keep creative control while iterating quickly.

## Cross‑tool workflow
- Use in the browser, via a Chrome extension, or inside Figma with the official plugin.
- Export assets or code and bring them into your own project.

## Export options
- Standards‑based HTML/CSS output; works with popular frameworks.
- Export and adapt on your terms.

## Credits model
- Credits are consumed only when you confirm and accept a result.
- Preview, adjust, and iterate for free until you approve (per Pro plan terms).
