  <Accordion title="What is UIdraft and how does it work?">
    <p><strong>Describe your vision — UIdraft brings it to life</strong><br />
    UIdraft is an AI-powered design assistant that helps you create user interfaces with ease. Simply describe what you want in plain language, and UIdraft will generate clean, professional layouts using smart templates and style-aware AI.</p>
    <p><strong>Edit like a designer — with full control</strong><br />
    What makes UIdraft powerful is its flexibility — the generated content is fully editable. You can freely adjust layouts, colors, text, and images just like working on a traditional design draft, giving you complete creative control.</p>
    <p><strong>Work across tools and export with ease</strong><br />
    UIdraft works across platforms: you can use it in your browser, through a Chrome extension, or inside Figma via the official plugin. Once you're happy with the result, you can export assets or code and bring them directly into your own project.</p>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What does the free plan include?">
    <p><strong>Try for free — with essential features</strong><br />
    The free plan lets anyone explore UIdraft with no upfront commitment. You get a monthly allowance of credits, which are deducted only after each successful generation.</p>
    <p><strong>Full creative access — with some limits</strong><br />
    You can freely create and modify designs, with the same editing freedom as paid users. However, the number of final outputs you can accept is limited by your available credits.</p>
    <p><strong>Upgrade for more power</strong><br />
    Features like private projects, advanced templates, and larger credit allowances are available with a paid plan.</p>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is a credit and how is it consumed?" id="credit-faq">
    <p><strong>What is a Credit?</strong><br />
    Credits are the currency used in UIdraft to generate results. Whether you're creating, editing, or refining, credits are only consumed when you confirm and accept a result.</p>
    <p><strong>How Credits Work</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Free Plan & Plus Plan: Credits are deducted immediately after each successful generation.</li>
      <li>Pro Plan: A real-time credit estimate is shown during the process. Credits are only deducted once you approve the final result.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Designed for Control and Confidence</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Only pay for what you approve</li>
      <li>No risk, no pressure</li>
      <li>Unlimited previews before accepting</li>
      <li>Don't like the result? No credits deducted</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example Prompts and Credit Cost</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Remove the header section" → 0.1 credits</li>
      <li>"Generate a login page" → 0.5 credits</li>
      <li>"Generate a homepage with a hero image and 3 sections" → 1.0 credit</li>
    </ul>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does UIdraft support specific technologies or frameworks?">
    <p><strong>Flexible output — ready for your stack</strong><br />
    UIdraft focuses on generating clean, modern UI layouts without locking you into a specific tech stack. It outputs standard HTML/CSS and supports popular frameworks.</p>
    <p><strong>Export and adapt — on your terms</strong><br />
    You can export your designs into React, Vue, or your preferred front-end setup. For designers, you can also push layouts directly into Figma for further editing.</p>
    <p><strong>Freedom-first design</strong><br />
    UIdraft emphasizes flexibility — all exported files are yours to adapt, extend, or integrate however you like.</p>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Who owns the designs I create?">
    <p><strong>You create it, you own it</strong><br />
    Everything you generate with UIdraft — layouts, content, assets — belongs to you. You're free to download, modify, reuse, or share your designs without restriction.</p>
    <p><strong>No lock-in, no fine print</strong><br />
    UIdraft does not retain ownership of your work. You control how it's used, where it goes, and who you share it with.</p>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does UIdraft integrate with Figma?">
    <p><strong>Yes — seamless collaboration between UIdraft and Figma</strong><br />
    UIdraft integrates smoothly with Figma through its official plugin. You can import your existing Figma design files into UIdraft and use AI-powered tools to optimize, refine, or rework your layouts. Likewise, any file created in UIdraft — whether generated by AI or built manually — can be exported back to Figma for further editing and teamwork.</p>
