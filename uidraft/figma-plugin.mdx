## The first Context‑Aware Design Copilot

### How it’s different from Figma Make

Figma Make is great for generating a page from scratch, but it doesn’t fully read your existing file’s design system. Our plugin works inside your current canvas, detecting your text styles, colors, variables, auto‑layout, and spacing — then generating new sections that match your layout rhythm and tone. Instead of starting over, you keep your design consistency and simply extend it.

## 🧠 Context‑Aware Generation

Powered by prompts, driven by context. UIdraft uses natural language prompts but doesn’t start from scratch. It creates with full awareness of your existing layout, structure, and style.

- ✅ Smart prompts guided by your current canvas
- ✅ Matches your layout rules, typography, spacing, and hierarchy
- ✅ No blank‑page confusion — real context for real design continuity

> 🆚 Unlike tools that generate disconnected mockups from generic prompts, UIdraft understands what’s already on your canvas and builds upon it seamlessly.

## 🪄 Page Completion & Extension

Start with a section, finish with a full page. UIdraft lets you sketch out a part of your design, then uses that as a foundation to generate the rest — matching your visual language, layout rhythm, and interaction patterns.

- ✅ “You create the first 30%, we’ll complete the remaining 70%”
- ✅ Fill in missing parts without disrupting your design
- ✅ All results are editable elements, not static screenshots

> 🆚 Unlike tools that generate one‑off screens, UIdraft helps you scale real work‑in‑progress files with precision.

## 🛠️ Frame‑Level Optimization

Skip pixel‑by‑pixel polishing. Select any frame or component group and prompt UIdraft to “make it cleaner,” “fix spacing,” or “organize the layout” — it handles the rest instantly.

- ✅ AI‑powered spacing, alignment, layout, and visual balance
- ✅ Works with messy frames, partial layouts, and rough components
- ✅ Keeps your design intact while making it better

## ⚡ Lightning Fast, Built for Flow

Instant results with no waiting and no hallucinations. Every action is grounded in what’s on your canvas and remains in your control.
