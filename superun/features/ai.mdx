Normally, adding AI to an app means hunting down API keys, setting up billing with providers, and wiring it all together yourself. Superun AI makes it simple to quickly add powerful AI features to your web applications so you can start building smarter and more engaging apps right away. Some examples include:

* **AI-powered content generation** – automatically create engaging copy, blog posts, and marketing materials
* **Smart chatbots and assistants** – build conversational interfaces that understand context and provide helpful responses
* **Intelligent form handling** – auto-complete forms, validate inputs, and provide smart suggestions
* **Content analysis and insights** – understand user behavior, sentiment, and engagement patterns
* **Automated workflows** – trigger AI actions based on user interactions and data changes
* **Multilingual support** – automatically translate content and provide localized experiences
* **Image and document processing** – extract text, analyze content, and generate descriptions from uploaded files
* **Smart recommendations** – suggest relevant content, products, or actions based on user preferences
* **Automated testing and optimization** – AI-driven A/B testing and performance improvements

## Enabling Superun AI

For the best experience, we recommend using Superun AI with your Supabase integration for data persistence and user management.

By default, Superun AI is enabled for your project and ready to use. This means Superun automatically adds AI functionality when you request it in your prompts or through the visual editor. You can manage AI behavior in your project settings.

### Default AI model

Superun AI uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** as the default model for most tasks. If you want to use a different model or combination of models, you can specify your choice directly in your prompts or through the AI settings panel.

### AI Integration Options

The default setting for AI integration is **Always available**, meaning Superun AI will be automatically used in your projects when requested. You can configure AI behavior in your project settings:

* **Always available**: Superun automatically performs AI actions when requested, without additional confirmation.
* **Ask for confirmation**: Superun asks for your approval before executing AI-powered features.
* **Disabled**: AI features are not available for the current project.

## Usage and Pricing

Superun AI runs on a **usage-based pricing model**. This means your costs scale with how much you use AI features and are not covered by your Superun subscription. The cost of using Superun AI is exactly the same as going directly to the AI provider. There are no hidden fees.

You can top up your AI balance as needed, with costs depending on the AI model you choose.

You can track and manage your AI usage costs in the **Credits** section of your project dashboard.

## Supported AI Models

Superun AI uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** as its default model, but you can specify different models in your prompts or through the AI settings.

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [**Gemini 2.5 Pro**](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/pro/) | Smartest and most complex Gemini. High reasoning, large context, slower and most expensive. | Deep reasoning, advanced coding, research, complex multimodal tasks |
| [**Gemini 2.5 Flash (default)**](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/flash/) | Balanced model. Faster and cheaper than Pro but still capable of reasoning. Mid-range cost. | Assistants, analysis, general workflows where speed + intelligence balance matters |
| [**Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite**](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/flash-lite/) | Fastest and cheapest Gemini. Handles simple tasks at scale, less reasoning depth. | High-volume, lightweight tasks like classification, summarization, translation |
| [**GPT-5**](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/) | Smartest OpenAI model. Strong reasoning, very accurate, but slowest and most expensive. | Highest-quality reasoning, accuracy-critical apps, complex decision making |
| [**GPT-5 Mini**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5-mini) | Balanced GPT-5. Cheaper and faster than GPT-5, less complex but strong general use. | Assistants, mid-complexity reasoning, business workflows |
| [**GPT-5 Nano**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5-nano) | Cheapest and fastest GPT-5. Very basic reasoning, best for quick or simple responses. | Summaries, classification, extraction, high-volume simple tasks |

### Best and most cost-effective choices

* **Best overall intelligence**: GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (deep reasoning, but most expensive)
* **Best balance (speed + cost + smartness)**: GPT-5 Mini and Gemini 2.5 Flash
* **Most cost-effective for scale**: GPT-5 Nano and Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite (simple, fast, cheapest)
