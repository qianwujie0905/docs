## Agent Mode

Agent mode gives Superun stronger autonomy to think, plan, and take actions for complex tasks:
- Interpret your intent and break it into steps
- Explore and read code as needed
- Fix and refactor problematic code
- Proactively debug; inspect logs and network requests
- Detect and resolve errors to reduce back‑and‑forth
- Retrieve docs/assets from the web when appropriate
- Generate and edit image assets

With deeper context understanding and live debugging, Agent mode produces more stable outcomes with fewer errors.

> Billing: Agent mode is usage‑based. More complex messages cost more (see announcements and pricing).
