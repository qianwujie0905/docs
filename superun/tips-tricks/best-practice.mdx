This guide helps you build more efficiently in Superun and avoid common pitfalls.

## 1. Use Custom Knowledge as your project brain
- Document product vision, key user journeys, core features, and design rules
- Define roles and boundaries (Admin/User/Investor, etc.)
- This knowledge is referenced continuously and improves future edits

> Ask AI example:
```
Generate knowledge for my project at T=0 based on features implemented.
```

## 2. Prompting best practices
- Be specific: point to the page/module and expected behavior
- Do one thing at a time; implement in chunks and validate
- Specify do‑not‑touch areas (Do not touch ...)
- Include screenshots/screencasts for clarity

> Ask AI template:
```
On page /settings, implement [feature]. Expected: [XYZ].
Please don’t touch component A / layout B / shared logic unless necessary.
```

## 3. Supabase and full‑stack pacing
- Stabilize the frontend first, then connect Supabase
- Validate database schema compatibility before rolling back versions

> Ask AI:
```
Validate SQL schema at T=0 and ensure no breaking changes.
```

## 4. Make quick UI changes with Editable Design
- Visual edits for copy/colors/typography/spacing/responsiveness are faster and safer
- Boxify consumes credits; other edits do not

## 5. Leverage versions and diffs
- Pin each known‑good state
- Use version diffs to locate problematic changes

> Ask AI:
```
Compare version at T–1 to T–0. What changed and what might break?
```

## 6. Use Remix as a reset option
- If stuck in error loops or heavy tech debt, use Remix to rebuild from a clean baseline
- Disconnect Supabase before remixing connected projects

## 7. Small steps, always reversible
- Break work into smallest verifiable increments
- After each step, do regression checks and user‑flow validation

## 8. Docs and community
- Read docs flows and templates; search first when issues arise
- Organize your issue and context before asking for help

## 9. Security and compliance basics
- Never paste secrets; use backend env vars/secrets
- Least privilege, environment isolation, pre‑publish security checks
