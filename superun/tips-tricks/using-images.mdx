description: "Common ways to add and replace images in Superun"
---

There are four common ways to add images to your project:

## 1. Upload the image to the prompt chat
Upload directly in chat and specify placement and size. Superun will insert and style it.

## 2. Replace it on the Editable Design
1. Open Editable Design (palette icon in the top nav)
2. Select the image placeholder you want to replace
3. Choose a new image to complete the replacement

## 3. Using an external image URL
Reference externally hosted images (mind the license), for example:

```
Use the image from this URL https://example.com/hero.png for the hero section image.
```

## 4. Using images from your GitHub public directory
Place images under the repo `public/` directory and reference by path, for example:

```
Use image from my repo: public/brand/hero.jpg
```

> For large images, optimize size and dimensions to avoid load and preview slowdowns.
