How to bring your vision to life with Superun.

## Who This Is For
For builders who have ideas but get stuck in execution—this helps you move from fuzzy concepts to a clear product.

## The Common Pitfall
A common mistake is starting before goals are clear, which compounds errors and rework.

## Best Practices
1. Outline 5–10 key points outside Superun first
2. List the core features for your MVP
3. Choose a build approach (frontend‑first or backend‑first)
4. Build in bricks—one thing at a time, small and fast
5. Write goal‑driven prompts; avoid doing five things at once
6. When stuck in loops: investigate → roll back if needed → try a different approach
7. If the project becomes messy: Remix to restart (keep learnings and history)
8. Validate early with real users; target feedback from 10 potential users
9. Practice with small projects to raise your overall skills

## Builder’s Checklist
Progress via checklist: key points, MVP, build approach, brick‑by‑brick, when to connect Supabase, Remix, and feedback collection.
