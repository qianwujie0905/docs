## Two Ways

### 1. One-Shot Generation
Generate the full page in one go:

```
You are a CRO expert. Build a landing page for [your product/audience], following conversion best practices.
```

### 2. Section-by-Section
Build section by section: Hero, Pricing, FAQ, Gallery…
1) Generate a blank Hero → 2) Use Editable Design to adjust copy/colors/layout → 3) Add images/animations/pricing → 4) Align theme (dark/glass/neon, etc.)

## Layout Inspiration & Tools
- Mobbin: real examples
- 21st.dev: animations/components
- Remove.bg: background removal
- Replicate: AI icons and illustrations

## Advanced
- P5.js custom effects (particles/parallax/starfield)
- Resend for contact and auto‑replies
- Stripe payment links
- Supabase for form storage and abuse protection

## CRO 101
- Single primary goal (Call/Buy/Waitlist)
- Clear headline and social proof
- Layout matches user expectations

## Static vs Dynamic
Static by default; add dynamic capabilities with forms, Supabase, Stripe, etc.
