# Editable Design

Entry point: the palette icon in the middle of the top navigation. Click to enter, and the current page becomes fully editable visually.

In Superun’s Editable Design, you can edit the entire page WYSIWYG: select any element to modify it directly, or use prompts to fine‑tune layout and styles—without touching code.


## Credits

- Boxify (structuring the page into box model/operable groups) consumes credits.
- Other edits (text, colors, spacing, typography, alignment, radii, shadows, image replacement, etc.) are free.

## When to Use Editable Design

Use it for:
- Copy changes and localization placeholders
- Fonts, sizes, weights, letter/line spacing
- Color themes and button/link/section colors
- Layout and grids (Flex/Grid), alignment/distribution, auto‑layout
- Spacing (padding/margin), radii, shadows, borders
- Responsive breakpoints (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- Replacing/cropping images and icons; illustration placeholders
- Component‑level tweaks and state styles (hover/active/disabled)

## How to Access and Use Editable Design

1. Click the palette icon in the top nav to enter Editable Design
2. Hover and click to select the target element, or enable Boxify to structure the page (only Boxify consumes credits)
3. Use side tools or the command palette to edit typography/colors/layout/spacing, etc.
4. For larger changes, use prompts to apply batch/linked updates (prompts are billed as regular messages)
5. Click Update prototype to apply changes and update preview and code instantly
