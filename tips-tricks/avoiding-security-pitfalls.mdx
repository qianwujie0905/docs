# Avoiding Security Pitfalls

## Don’t paste secrets in chat
Store sensitive info in backend env vars or a secrets manager and access via functions.

## Least privilege and environment isolation
Separate production/test/dev; grant roles/tokens on a need‑to‑use basis to avoid wide privileges.

## Dependency and build security
Upgrade dependencies regularly, enable SCA/CI scanning; avoid bundling large secrets or certificates into the frontend.

## API and data security
All public endpoints must enforce auth and rate limits; validate inputs and file uploads; protect PII and privacy data.

## Pre‑publish checks
Run an automated checklist before publishing: secret leakage, debug flags, error logging, CORS policy, etc.
